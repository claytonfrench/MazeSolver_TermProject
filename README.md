# Maze Generator and Solver

This program allows the user to select from three different algorithms that generate mazes. The maze will be drawn in the console, and also to a bitmap file. A solver class will then find a path through the maze from left to right, and highlight the path in a new bitmap file.

# Running the Program
1.) The executable can be found in the /build folder

2.) Run the file with your chosen width, height, and algorithm (e.g. "./Main.exe -w 10 -h 10 -a kruskal" )

      * "dfs" for Depth First Search
      
      * "bfs" for Breadth First Search
      
      * "kruskal" for Kruskal's Algorithm
      
3.) The bitmap files can be find in the /build folder.
